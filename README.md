# Object-Oriented Programming: Image Manipulation

## Description

This project focuses on the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ through practical tasks involving image manipulation. 
The project's primary objective is to demonstrate the application of OOP principles while unshuffling and de-noising a logo from the University of Lincoln.

### Project Tasks

1. **Unshuffling the Logo**:
   - The task was to take the university's logo that had its pixels randomly shuffled and develop a program to restore the logo by comparing it against the original.

2. **Denoising the Logo**:
   - For this task, the original university logo was modified by adding 'noise' to it. The goal was to create a program that could remove this noise and yield a clear representation of the original logo.

## Features

- **Class Structure**: Utilizes OOP principles to encapsulate functionality related to image manipulation, enhancing code organization and reusability.
  
- **Image Comparison**: Implements algorithms to compare the current state of the logo with the original to restore accuracy through both tasks.

- **Noise Removal**: Applies techniques to effectively reduce noise while preserving the essential features of the logo.
